What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

I think I understood the general concept of the assignment and actually coding really helped me to understand the difference between procedural and object-oriented programming. It worked to just focus on the objectives in the rubric & to come up with a brief pseudocode plan before I began. However, I wish I'd started earlier to give myself more time and used my resources... I would tell someone taking this course in the future to take advantage of all the resources you have available to you (TA's, office hours, class time, etc. etc.) because they will save you so much work and time!
